  <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
    I walk a path where the boundaries between technology and human thought blur. The lure of AGI, the mysteries of space, and the promise of fusion energy—these fascinate me not because of their finality, but because they represent the unknown, the unconquered. My work in web development is, at its core, an extension of this desire to understand, to create meaning in a world driven by logic yet guided by emotion. Through code, I build not just applications, but windows into the mind.
